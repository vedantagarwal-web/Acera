- **Real-time financial data extraction** with superior accuracy
- **Institutional-grade analysis capabilities** combining search and reasoning
- **Web search integration** with citation support and recency filtering

### 2. Enhanced Data Collection
- **Universal stock data retrieval** with JSON-structured responses
- **Real-time market sentiment analysis** 
- **Comprehensive financial metrics** (P/E, market cap, 52-week ranges, etc.)
- **Quality scoring system** (95% confidence with Perplexity vs 40% fallback)

### 3. AI Analyst Enhancement (`intelligent_analyst.py`)
- **Multi-analyst team** (6 specialists: Fundamental, Technical, Macro, Risk, ESG, Quant)
- **Perplexity-enhanced prompts** providing real-time market context

```

### Comprehensive Analysis
```python
# Generate Wall Street-grade research report
report = await intelligent_analyst.generate_perplexity_enhanced_report('PLCE')
